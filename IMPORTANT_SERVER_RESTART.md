# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Server Restart Required

## Current Status
- All code fixes have been applied ✅
- Database structure is correct ✅
- Server is still using OLD model definitions ❌

## The Problem
The running server (in Terminal 1) has cached the old AuditLog model definition without the field mappings. This causes the "Unknown column 'ip_address'" error even though we've fixed the code.

## Solution: Restart the Server

### Terminal 1:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the current server
2. Run `npm run dev` to start with the updated code

### Terminal 2 (this terminal):
After server restart, run:
```bash
node test-auth-endpoints.js
```

## Expected Results After Restart
✅ Registration will work (no more column errors)
✅ All authentication endpoints will function properly
✅ Proper error codes in all responses

## Why This Happens
Node.js caches required modules. When using `nodemon` in development, it only watches for file changes but doesn't always properly reload Sequelize model definitions, especially when field mappings change.
