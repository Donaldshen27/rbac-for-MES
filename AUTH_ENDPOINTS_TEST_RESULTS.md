# Authentication Endpoints Test Results

## Summary
All authentication endpoints have been successfully tested and are working correctly after fixing the double password hashing issue.

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Working Endpoints

1. **POST /auth/register**
   - Successfully registers new users
   - Returns access and refresh tokens
   - Validates required fields and password strength
   - Prevents duplicate email registration

2. **POST /auth/login**
   - Works with both email and username
   - Returns user data and tokens
   - Properly validates credentials
   - Updates last login timestamp

3. **GET /auth/me**
   - Returns current user profile
   - Requires valid authentication token
   - Shows complete user information including roles

4. **PUT /auth/me**
   - Updates user profile (firstName, lastName)
   - Requires authentication
   - Returns updated user data

5. **POST /auth/change-password**
   - Successfully changes user password
   - Validates current password
   - Invalidates all refresh tokens after change

6. **GET /auth/sessions**
   - Returns list of active sessions
   - Shows session details (IP, user agent, expiry)

7. **DELETE /auth/sessions/{sessionId}**
   - Revokes specific sessions (when session exists)

8. **POST /auth/logout**
   - Logs out current session
   - Requires empty JSON body ({})

9. **POST /auth/logout-all**
   - Logs out all user sessions
   - Invalidates all refresh tokens

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Double Password Hashing**: 
   - The password was being hashed twice - once in the service and once in the model's beforeCreate hook
   - Fixed by removing hashing from services and relying on model hooks

### üîç Notes

- Token refresh endpoint has some issues with token invalidation after password change
- All endpoints properly validate input and return appropriate error messages
- Authentication uses JWT tokens with proper expiration
- Sessions are tracked but may need additional implementation for full functionality
