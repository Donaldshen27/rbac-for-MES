# Server Restart Required

The authentication fixes have been applied, but the server needs to be restarted to pick up the model changes.

## Why Restart is Needed
- Modified AuditLog model to add field mappings for snake_case columns
- The running server still has the old model definition cached
- Database columns are correct (ip_address, user_agent) but Sequelize is not using the field mappings

## To Restart:
1. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in terminal 1)
2. Run `npm run dev` again

## Expected Result After Restart:
- Registration endpoint should work correctly
- No more "Unknown column 'ip_address'" errors
- All authentication endpoints should function properly
